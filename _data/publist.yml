- title: "Combinatorial optimization and reasoning with graph neural networks"
  image: GNN-pic.png
  description:  "Combinatorial optimization is a well-established area in operations research and computer science. 
  Until recently, its methods have focused on solving problem instances in isolation,
   ignoring the fact that they often stem from related data distributions in practice. 
   However, recent years have seen a surge of interest in using machine learning, 
   especially graph neural networks, as a key building block for combinatorial tasks. 
   This paper presents a conceptual review of recent key advancements in this emerging field, 
  aiming at researchers in both optimization and machine learning"

- title: "Dynamic Routing and Wavelength Assignment with Reinforcement Learning"
  image: IJOO23.png
  description:  "With the rapid developments in communication systems, and considering their dynamic nature, all-optical
  networks are becoming increasingly complex. This paper proposes a novel method based on deep reinforcement 
  learning for the routing and wavelength assignment problem in all-optical wavelength-decision-multiplexing networks. 
  We employ graph neural networks to capture crucial latent information from the graph-structured input to develop the optimal strategy. 
  The proposed deep reinforcement learning algorithm selects a route and a wavelength simultaneously for each incoming traffic connection
  as they arrive."

- title: "Explaining the Behavior of Reinforcement Learning Agents using Association Rules"
  image: LION2023-game.jpg
  description:  "Deep reinforcement learning algorithms are increasingly used to drive decision-making systems. 
  However, there exists a known tension between the efficiency of a machine learning algorithm and its level of explainability. 
  Generally speaking, increased efficiency comes with the cost of decisions that are harder to explain.
  This paper proposes to explain the behaviour of a deep reinforcement learning algorithm thanks to standard data mining tools, 
  i.e. association rules. We apply this idea to the design of playing bots, which is ubiquitous in the video game industry."

- title: "Repositioning Fleet Vehicles: a Learning Pipeline"
  image: LION2023-fleet.jpg
  description:  "Managing a fleet of vehicles under uncertainty requires careful planning and adaptability. 
  We consider a ride-hailing problem where the operator manages vehicle repositioning to maximize responsiveness.
  This paper introduces a supervised learning pipeline that uses past trip data to reposition vehicles while adapting to fleet activity, 
  a geographical zone, and seasonal or daily request variation. 
  This tool has been developed for, and used by, operators of an ambulance company in Belgium. 
  Using predictors for ambulance repositioning reduces at least 10% of the overall fleet reaction distance."

- title: "Training a Deep Q-Learning Agent Inside a Generic Constraint Programming Solver"
  image: CP2023-tom.jpg
  description:  "Constraint programming is known for being an efficient approach for solving combinatorial problems. 
  Important design choices in a solver are the branching heuristics, which are designed to lead the search to the best solutions in a minimum amount of time.
  Although several generic variable-selection heuristics are available in the literature, 
  the options for a generic value-selection heuristic are more scarce.
  This paper introduces a generic learning procedure that can be used to obtain a value-selection heuristic 
  inside a constraint programming solver. This has been achieved thanks to the combination of a deep Q-learning algorithm, a tailored reward signal, 
  and a heterogeneous graph neural network architecture."

  image: CP2022-HQ.png
  description:  "Modern electrical power utilities must maintain their electrical equipment 
  and replace it when the end of its useful life arrives.
  The Transmission Maintenance Scheduling (TMS) problem consists in 
   generating an annual maintenance plan for electric power transportation equipment 
   while maintaining the stability of the network and ensuring a continuous power flow 
   for customers. Each year, a list of equipment (power lines, capacitors, transistors, etc.)
    that needs to be maintained or replaced is available and the goal
     is to generate an optimal maintenance plan.
      This paper proposes a constraint-based scheduling approach for
       solving the TMS problem."

- title: "Learning the travelling salesperson problem requires rethinking generalization"
  image: CP2021-pic.png
  description:  "End-to-end training of neural network solvers for 
  combinatorial problems such as the Travelling Salesman Problem 
  is intractable and inefficient beyond a few hundreds of nodes. 
  While state-of-the-art Machine Learning approaches perform closely to classical solvers for trivially small sizes,
   they are unable to generalize the learnt policy to larger instances.
   This paper proposes controlled experiments in the first principled investigation into such zero-shot generalization,
    revealing that extrapolating beyond training data requires rethinking the entire neural combinatorial optimization
    pipeline. "
